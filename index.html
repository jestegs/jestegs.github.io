                <p> add this to writing section after editing
                    My format for this site is somewhat of a rejection of the instant-feedback
                    mechanisms of social media. I'd love for personal websites to become
                    mainstream again like they were during the era of Geocities and the like,
                    where people treated their posts with a little more care than they do now.
                    In my experience, social media is good for some things, but those things definitely
                    do not include constructive discussion, and posts are suprisingly lacking in personality,
                    per the structure of the apps. It is time consuming and difficult to keep up with writing
                    significant posts, so nobody should expect them often, but hopefully they are more enriching
                    to the readers.

                    <p>
                        I've been in the process of typing up my dream journals for the past few years,
                        and while doing so I began to get fed up with Microsoft Word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to be able to write down the dreams free of any distraction or over-bearing
                        syntax, but I also wanted to post it on a website, like I do here. I began writing a
                        program that would parse the Word doc, and convert all the stuff to a more readable
                        HTML format, but I quickly realised this was not ideal because if I wanted to change
                        something, I would have to search the huge Word document to find the error, then recompile
                        the whole HTML document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all it was a bad way of doing what I wanted to do, not to mention that I had to use the bulky,
                        account-necessary Microsoft Word to do it. So I made my own digital journalling application
                        for this incredibly specific purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are still a few bugs I have to iron out and minor features to add, but despite being
                        called Dream Journaller, it can be used journal anything in a simple and distraction free way.

                        This is a duo-project my classmate and I did for our principles of A.I. class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a pretty straight forward implementation of the popular A-Star pathfinding
                        algorithm, which is a more optimal version of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We made it a priority to represent visually what is going on while the algorithm
                        does its thing and to let the user play around with the environment to see how it
                        responds. I don't think either of us have gotten around to extending the user
                        interfacing options like we had hoped, but maybe I'll return to it one day.

                        A spacecraft "simulator" prototype game made with the Godot Engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is mainly to test out an idea that instead of using simple keyboard
                        key presses for controlling a vehicle, you have to click UI elements on the screen.
                        The whole point of the experiment is that I can take something that is really simple
                        and boring and make it something complex and hopefully more interesting to engage with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm trying this idea out with a couple other things, but the reason I have focused so
                        much on the spacecraft idea is because I think it more naturally fits. I'm taking a lot of 
                        inspiration from 
                        Orbiter, the spaceflight simulator, for how the craft is controlled, but instead of having
                        hotkeys, the player is stuck with finding the switch on a cryptic dashboard and moving their
                        mouse over to press it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of, say, holding shift to fire the thrusters, the player must turn on the battery
                        that powers the various systems of the ship. Then, to orient in the correct direction,
                        they must turn on the power for the Reaction Control Thrusters and turn the dial to the 
                        appropriate mode. Then the power for the main engine must be turned on, and the throttle 
                        lever can be pulled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much more complicated, and I hope much more interesting, than just a few key presses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll see where this goes...
