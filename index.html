            <hr class="divider">
            <p>
                I'm Jacob Stegenga, currently a Mathematics/Computer Science student
                at Salem State University.

                This is a website where I post various updates about my life, projects, and ideas, 
                and is just generally a place to compile and organize myself online.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am mainly focusing on personal programming projects and videogames that
                you can find on my

                keep a <a class="inline_a" href=#dreams>Dream Journal</a>, and 
                may (hopefully) get around to some

                    This is a duo-project my classmate and I did for our principles of A.I. class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a pretty straight forward implementation of the popular A-Star pathfinding
                    algorithm, which is a more optimal version of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made it a priority to represent visually what is going on while the algorithm
                    does its thing and to let the user play around with the environment to see how it
                    responds. I don't think either of us have gotten around to extending the user
                    interfacing options like we had hoped, but maybe I'll return to it one day.
