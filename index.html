                        I've been in the process of typing up my dream journals for the past few years,
                        and while doing so I began to get fed up with the way a lot of text editing programs are organized.
                        I wanted to be able to write down the dreams free of any distraction or over-bearing
                        syntax, and I also wanted to have the dreams separately accessible, instead of all in
						one constant stream of a word document. 
                    </p>
					<p>
						This journalling program allows you to work on each journal entry individually,
						and organize them into a particular journal to keep track of. Then, you can load old
						entries to read or edit further. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The journals are built using sqlite3 plugin for python, so all the data is accessible with SQL commands
						in a database file. I constructed a GUI with a python implementation of Qt user interface development.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        There are still a few bugs I have to iron out and minor features to add, but despite being
                        called Dream Journaller, it can be used journal anything in a simple and distraction free way.

                        This is a duo-project my classmate and I did for our Principles of A.I. class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a pretty straight forward implementation of the popular A-Star pathfinding
                        algorithm, which is a more optimal version of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We made it a priority to represent visually what is going on while the algorithm
                        does its thing and to let the user play around with the environment to see how it
                        responds. I don't think either of us have gotten around to extending the user
                        interfacing options like we had hoped, but maybe I'll return to it one day.
